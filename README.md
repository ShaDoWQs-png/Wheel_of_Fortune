# Wheel of Fortune

This is a project made for Arduino, similar to Wheel of Fortune, where you have to stop a "spinning" LED at a specific spot. PlatformIO was used to upload and compile all code in the project, and was originally built on an Arduino UNO R4 WIFI. Support for the Attiny84 has also been added recently.

## Dependencies:
- LiquidCrystal_I2C
- PlatformIO
